> ℹ️ **Why the backend is private:**  
> The backend contains sensitive implementation details such as business logic, internal infrastructure references, and security-critical code (e.g., authentication, access control, IP and service integration logic). To prevent misuse and protect intellectual property, the backend repository is kept private. However, full access can be provided to SCF evaluators upon request.
